                        <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
                        <h3>Origin</h3>
                        <div><img class="centerimage border" src="img/johnny.jpg" alt="Image of Tsung"></div>
                        <p>I am originally from Taiwan. I left my homeland country at the age of four and a half for Belize, in Central America. My family travelled and moved from several Central America and South America countries. My experiences in Belize were unbelievable. If you have some time, definitely check out Belize as the waters and the environment are unlike any.</p>

                        <p>In 2001, my family moved to the United States. Living in Central America heightened my curiosities to how understand how local communities, limited by resources and even crippled by diseases, struggle to move forward. Though these curiosities, I have been fortunate to explore these topics further, in terms of, social theory and public health issues. </p>

                        <p>As a graduating senior at the University of Chicago, I have had the opportunity to delve deeper into my interests in social theory, public health, arts, and basic science research. In fact, before I was a Visual Arts major, I was a Biology (pre-med) major for three years. My experience with basic science research in oncology have further sparked my interests to pursue a masters public health in the near future.</p>

                        <h3>Practice</h3>
                        <p>I am a multimedia artist who enjoys working with sculptures, collages, animations, documentary filmmaking, and photography. The ability to play with different media and create something anew is something I love to do. Since 2007, I have continued to work as a freelance photographer and have been fortunate to have the opportunity to work with great politicians, individuals, and celebrities. Aside from the art world and my freelancing, I am highly interested in 3D printing, rapid-prototyping, entrepreneurship, and coding. I am taking classes at the Starter League (Downtown Chicago) to learn Advanced HTML/CSS. The quarter before, I took User Experience (UX). </p>

                        <p>My journey has started with coding and art and please do check out my journey at either my Art or Design sections.</p>

                        <h3>Current</h3>
                        <p>As graduation nears, I look forward to working at a startup as a fellow for Venture for America.</p>

                        <p>Since November 2011, I have been working independently on my own documentary. The title of my documentary is <strong>Seeing Positively</strong>. This documentary explores the process of empowerment among three African Americans underwent a combination of religious oppression, sexual abuse, drugs and gangs, and prostitution. </p>
