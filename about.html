                        <h3>Origin</h3>
                        <div><img class="centerimage border" src="img/johnny.jpg" alt="Image of Tsung"></div>
                        <p>Originally born in Taiwan, I left my homeland country at the age of four and a half for Belize. Travelled with family to several Central America and South America countries. In 2001, my family moved to the United States. The opportunities to live in different third-world countries have allowed me to experience how communities function when faced with limited resources. This interests and experiences have allowed to me explore social theory and now public health. </p>

                        <p>As a graduating senior at the University of Chicago, I have had the opportunity to delve deeper into my interests in social theory, public health, arts, and basic science research. All of these facets opened a lot of doors for me and I am happy to explore these routes. </p>

                        <h3>Practice</h3>
                        <p>I am a multimedia artist who enjoys working with sculptures, collages, animations, documentary filmmaking, and photography. The ability to play with different media and create something anew is something I love to do. Since 2007, I have continued to work as a freelance photographer and had work with great politicians, individuals, and celebrities. Aside from the art world and my freelancing, I am dabbling in 3D printing and entrepreneurship. Also, I am taking classes at the Starter League (Downtown Chicago) to learn Advanced HTML/CSS and took User Experience (UX) last quarter. </p>

                        <p>My journey has started and please do check out my journey at either my Art or Design section.</p>

                        <h3>Current</h3>
                        <p>As graduation nears, I look forward to be a fellow at Venture for America</p>

                        <p>Since November 2011, I have been working independently on my own documentary. The title is Seeing Positively. This documentary explores the process of empowerment among three African Americans underwent a combination of religious oppression, sexual abuse, drugs and gangs, and prostitution. </p>
