               <h3>Week 1 to Week 3 Summary Experience</h3>
               <h4>April 25th, 2013</h4>
               <p>The first three weeks at the Starter League flew by so quickly. I had learned so much from Shay (the instructor) that I want to use this blog to communicate my journey and development. The <a class="blog-anchors" href="design.html" target="_blank"><strong>Design</strong><img src="img/ui-tab-arrow.png" alt="Icon for New Window"></a> section will provide my work as I learn more concepts from class.</p>

               <p>The opportunity to take the User Experience (UX) with Carolyn, the instructor, have allowed me to understand different methods and models of how user testing work. After taking her class, my urge to continue my intellectual growth really made me look forward to <a href="http://www.starterleague.com/advhtmlcss" target="_blank">Advanced HTML/CSS</a>. The opportunity to learn on my own was simply not enough and I wanted to take my skills to the next level. I felt combination of UX and front-end development went well together and having these two skills will allow me to develop and implement great user-friendly site.</p>

                <p>Before the first week of class, Shay has previously sent us the Beginner Guide to HTML/CSS to brush up on any unstable concepts that we might have forgotten. Since I did not take his Beginner HTML/CSS class, I did not know what I am missing. However, his guide was able to provide a sufficient overview of the concepts I have self-taught myself. The simplicity of the guide allowed me to go through the guide pretty quickly. Though the guide did not have any assignments or exercises to reinforce the concepts, a great method to insuring I grasp the concept was to first read through each section.  This first read gave me a better sense of the overall of the topic. If any topics confused me, I will return back to the section and actually try to follow along with my text editor, Sublime Text.</p>

                <p><strong>Week 1</strong>: Similar to standard grammar and syntax, one can write HTML/CSS in many ways. However, some forms will be better than others. This week, we learned the importance to write clean, or lean, codes by taking out unnecessary fillers. Personally, I think it is hard to write clean codes because no one has ever told me what is great or bad codes. Shay does a fine job of explain these concepts to me. After going through his lesson and lecture for that week, I quickly realized some instances of what are bad codes. He discussed specificity with IDs, classes, and their related syntax.</p>

                <p>After Shay showed us some great example of how bad codes can easily transform to good code habits, we later had the chance to practice. In class, our task was to create a set of buttons while maintaining clean, or lean codes. This was challenging but fun at the same time. Swing by Design to check out the results.</p>


                <p><strong>Week 2: </strong>After week 1 gave a good overview of what to expect for the class. Shay’s class began promptly at 6PM CST. This week was all about positions. There are so many thing associated with positions that quickly got confusing for me. What confuses me the most was using absolute and relative position frequently in CSS. When Shay was demonstrating with three positions, it was already challenging to follow, let alone when he added another position. The process can get quite complex when it comes to troubleshooting as this often times require me to comment out certain position to figure out what might have went wrong.</p>

                <p>Another aspect I had to go over several times in my head as I did the homework was the position for something. When declaring, in CSS, top: 600px;, I have to think from the top, I would push the object down 600px from the top position. Another interesting thing I have discovered is how CSS render something when I inputed this into the text editor and ran it: (this order) using bottom: 0; top: 0; right: 0; left: 0;  on a footer (with position as fixed) would cause the footer to adhesive to the top of the page. Anything I have had before the footer would disappear. This is particularly fascinating to me as I was wondering why it did this. Based on component testing, removing one and testing it out, I discovered it reads from top to bottom and as a result render the top and left as the final results.</p>

                <p>Although I do not entirely on this subject, I hope my experimentation with various possibilities and practice will help me grasp these position concepts.

                <p><strong>Week 3</strong>: Complex Selectors is week 3 focus and another jammed pack week. With each week’s introduction to new concepts, it can be challenging to learn and implement these learned concepts while juggling with other tasks of life. I am still experimenting with this week’s concepts and I think these topics are quite dense and powerful. The ability to use algebras on CSS already blows my mind. Most of this week’s development is actually in this blog. More to come ☺. I will post updates as I go.</p>
